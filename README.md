# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
Developed a logistic regression model in Python on Google Colaboratory to classify SONAR data into rocks or mines. Conducted data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

Problem Statement: The project aims to classify SONAR data into rocks or mines using logistic regression, which is a classic machine learning problem known as binary classification.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The code includes steps to load the SONAR dataset, explore its characteristics (such as shape and statistical measures), and preprocess it by splitting it into training and test sets.

Model Training and Evaluation: The logistic regression model is trained on the training data and evaluated for its performance using accuracy scores on both the training and test sets.

Predictive System: The code includes a predictive system that takes input data and uses the trained model to classify new instances as rocks or mines.
